\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


Writing this thesis would not have been possible without the support of several people whom I need to gratefully thank.

I wish to thank my supervisors prof.\ dr.\ Marko van Eekelen and dr.\ ir.\ Harald Vranken for providing me with the opportunity to write this thesis under their guidance.
Words cannot describe my gratitude towards Marko and Harald. Despite their busy schedules, they reserved some moments of their valuable time, they provided me with excellent feedback and guided me into the world of academia.
It has been a real pleasure working with both of you and I am looking forward to our next project together.
\emph{To PhD or not to PhD?} That is the question!

I would also like to thank dr.\ Anda Counotte-Portman for her valuable advices and assuring that there were no delays in study progress due to the Open University's part.
I am thankful to dr. Bastiaan Heeren for his availability and willingness to answer many of my questions during my study.

I would like to thank my parents. They introduced me to the wonderful world of computing by purchasing my first computer, the commodore 128.
My father, Hedwig, explained complex math problems in such a way that it was a real joy to find the solution myself when I was a child.
My late mother, Eleonore, who loved reading books, passed this characteristic on to me. I really enjoy reading and am thankful for that.
Thanks, Mom and Dad, for believing in me and providing me with the opportunities to pursue higher education.

When my younger and only brother, Delano, achieved his BSc degree, he motivated me to pursue my Masters.
Thank you for just being my brother and one of the first people of implicit or explicit motivation on my journey.

Finally, without the love and support from my wife Gracia, my son Qylan and daughter Kaylin, I would never have succeeded.
Gracia, my utmost respect for keeping up with all the late nights / early mornings during my study, always there providing me with the necessary drinks and/or food to keep going, not to mention my grumpy moods you gracefully dealt with when there were some setbacks.
Qylan, thanks for the time we spend together with the Martial Arts Training. Just an example of the good moments we experienced to take the mindset from research onto a different topic.
Kaylin, the funny faces you can put on, combined with the most hilarious story telling. Thanks for these example moments as well.
I thank you both, love you very much, am proud of you and I am proud to be your father.
Although all three of you had to cope with my absence often, you seldom complained.
Hopefully now, as the thesis is completed, we can spend more family time together.
